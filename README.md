# Snake

A simple Snake Game in Javascript from a course exercise.

I added some styling a dark-theme switch.

Oh, it also has mobile devices controls.

## Rules of the game

- You try to cross the borders, you ‚ò†Ô∏è.
- You drive into yourself, you ‚ò†Ô∏è.
- You try to reverse the snake, you ‚ò†Ô∏è.
